### VXSDR Examples

These are simple examples showing the use of the VXSDR API. C++ examples are
in the source and include directories, and Python examples in the python directory.

The C++ examples require the same C++ 20 features used by the library itself, so
they can be built on any platform that the library can be.

The Python examples require Python 3.10 or later.

The API documentation can be found at https://libvxsdr.readthedocs.io.
